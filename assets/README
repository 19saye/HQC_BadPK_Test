#  Award-Winning R&D: Automotive PQC Fault-Injection Lab
**3rd Place Winner** at the National Quantum & Deep Tech Competition (UNESCO-Supported)

###The Problem: "Quantum-Bricking" in Automotive Systems
As the automotive industry transitions to **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)**, a new vulnerability emerges: **Fault-Induced System Failure.** If a vehicle's telemetry chain receives a corrupted or tampered Public Key (BadPK) due to hardware bit-flips or cyber-attacks, the entire communication could "brick" (freeze), leading to critical safety risks in V2X environments.

### Project Mission
This project is a **Fault-Injection Testbed** designed to:
1. Simulate **Corrupted HQC Public Keys** within a synthetic automotive telemetry chain.
2. Analyze the resilience of KEM (Key Encapsulation Mechanisms) against **Spoofing**, **Replay Attacks**, and **False Data Injection (FDIA)**.
3. Prevent system lockdowns by ensuring the cryptographic layer gracefully rejects malformed keys.

## Experimental Analysis & Visualizations
*For technical details and methodology of these graphs, please see the [varlıklar/README.md](./varlıklar/README.md) file.*

#### 1. Telemetry Anomaly Detection
We simulated synthetic vehicle speed signals and injected anomalies to test if the PQC-protected layer can distinguish between normal signal noise and malicious tampering.

#### 2. Attack Simulations (Spoofing & Replay)
Our lab environment tests the HQC implementation against:
- **Replay Attacks:** Detecting stale but mathematically valid segments.
- **Spoofing:** Identifying entirely fabricated speed signals.
- **FDIA (False Data Injection):** Real-time detection of manipulated telemetry windows.

##  Technical Architecture
The study aligns with global automotive standards:
- **ISO 11898 (CAN-Bus)**
- **ISO 14229 (UDS)**
- **AUTOSAR SWS & W3C VSS**

*Note: This study uses synthetic data formatted like Porsche telemetry. No real vehicle data was used.*
